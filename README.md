# flipper_apps

wolfy's apps etc for flipper zero. 

## pong2

almost works. implemented an extremely simplified version of pong bounce-off-paddle logic by dividing paddle into 5 sections with hardcoded x and y speeds. such a small screen seemed silly to do it the real way. but that part actually works great, the problem is the collision detection is stupid. will fix sometime

## walk_guy

works! guy walks around. middle button shoots a projectile. woo hoo
this was actually the impetus for the bmp_drawer thing
